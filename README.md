 Object Detection using YOLOv8

 Introduction
 Object Detection using YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) is a cutting-edge approach for real-time detection and localization of objects in images and videos. Known for its high speed and accuracy, YOLOv8 is suitable for various applications like security, autonomous systems, and more. This project demonstrates how to train and use YOLOv8 for effective object detection tasks.
