 Object Detection using YOLOv8

# Introduction
Object Detection using YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) is a cutting-edge approach for real-time detection and localization of objects in images and videos. Known for its high speed and accuracy, YOLOv8 is suitable for various applications like security, autonomous systems, and more. This project demonstrates how to train and use YOLOv8 for effective object detection tasks. 

# Purpose: 
To object detection in images by using YOLOv8. <br />
Object detection is a computer technology related to computer vision and image processing that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings, or cars) in digital images and videos. When it comes to object detection, popular detection frameworks are
YOLO <br />
SSD <br />
Faster R-CNN <br />
